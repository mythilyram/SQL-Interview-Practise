Here are ten common SQL interview questions related to NULL values, along with their answers:

1. What is NULL in SQL?
  Answer: NULL represents the absence of a value in a field. It is not the same as an empty string or zero; it is an unknown or undefined value.

2. How to check for NULL values in a column?
  Answer: Use the `IS NULL` or `IS NOT NULL` condition in the WHERE clause.

   SELECT * FROM tableName WHERE columnName IS NULL;

3. What is the difference between NULL and an empty string?
  Answer: NULL represents the absence of a value, while an empty string is a valid string with zero length.

4. How to replace NULL values with a specific value in a query result?
  Answer: Use the `COALESCE` function.

   SELECT COALESCE(columnName, 'ReplacementValue') AS columnName FROM tableName;

5. Explain the behavior of the NULL value in aggregate functions.
  Answer: If an aggregate function encounters a NULL value, it generally ignores it, except for the `COUNT(*)` function, which counts all rows, including those with NULL values.

6. Can a table have multiple NULL values in a unique key column?
  Answer: Yes, a table can have multiple NULL values in columns that are part of a unique key or index. NULL is not considered equal to NULL in this context.

7. How to insert a NULL value into a column during data insertion?
  Answer: Simply omit the column from the INSERT statement or explicitly use the keyword NULL.

   INSERT INTO tableName (column1, column2) VALUES (value1, NULL);

8. Explain the use of the `ISNULL` function.
  - Answer: The `ISNULL` function returns the specified replacement value if the expression is NULL; otherwise, it returns the expression itself.

   SELECT ISNULL(columnName, 'ReplacementValue') AS columnName FROM tableName;

9. How to count the number of NULL values in a column?
  Answer: Use the `COUNT` function with a CASE statement.

   SELECT COUNT(CASE WHEN columnName IS NULL THEN 1 END) AS NullCount FROM tableName;

10. Can NULL values be indexed in SQL Server?
  Answer: Yes, NULL values can be indexed. However, keep in mind that querying for NULL values might be less efficient than querying for non-NULL values due to the way indexes work.

Remember, the key to success in SQL interviews is not just memorizing answers but understanding the underlying concepts. These questions cover a range of scenarios involving NULL values in SQL Server.
